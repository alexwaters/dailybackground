dailybackground
===============
This is an application that downloads the most viral images from imgur in the past 24 hours, filters them, and stores them in a folder so that you can run them as a background slideshow.

This still needs a lot of work to make it easier for most people to use, see the issues section if you're willing to write some python or help build executables.

For most people, here's how to run it (I haven't checked that this actually works, please confirm or tell me what went wrong):

OSX / Linux:
1. Open up command line
2. write "sudo easy_install pip"
3. write pip install imgurpython
4. download the application here: https://github.com/alexwaters/dailybackground/archive/master.zip
5. open it and run application.py
6. Wait a little while, and now you have a folder of the day's images (smaller than 2880x1800)
7. Change your desktop background and/or screensaver to grab the images from the file and display them sildeshow style.

Windows:
Wait for us to build an easy .exe or try to get python / the imgur dependency working
